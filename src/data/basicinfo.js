	bio:	  "I am a Software Engineer turned Engineering Manager who is currently taking a long break from the paid workforce. I have a varied background that has delved deeply into cloud orchestration, touched on experimentation, and followed that into developing and cataloguing all of the signals that give us those experimental results and more. In all of that, I am passionate about developing effective user experiences, writing clean code, and empowering developers to be their best selves.\n\nIn my free time I play video games, study languages and tech history, craft, and spend time with my friends and family.",
